# Email Analysis Process Guide

This document outlines the key steps to follow when analyzing emails in a cybersecurity context. Email-based attacks are one of the most common vectors for malware distribution and phishing attempts. A systematic approach helps in identifying malicious activities and taking preventive actions.

## 1. Identify the Context üìß
   Before diving into technical details, it‚Äôs crucial to understand the context of the email:
   - **Sender Information**: Who sent the email? Is it from a known contact, or does the domain look suspicious?
   - **Subject and Body**: What is the email about? Is the language alarming or requesting immediate action (e.g., password reset, account verification)?
   - **Timing**: When was the email received? Was it sent at an unusual time, possibly indicating automation or bot-like behavior?

   **Objective**: Establish if the email is unexpected, urgent, or looks unusual, which could hint at phishing or social engineering attempts.

## 2. Identify Domain/IP Links and Attachment Details üåê
   In this step, the focus is on extracting technical indicators:
   - **Links**: Review all hyperlinks in the email. Do they match the visible text, or do they redirect to suspicious domains? 
   - **IP Address**: Extract IPs from email headers to check where the email originated from.
   - **Domain Analysis**: Use tools like MXToolbox or VirusTotal to check the reputation of domains.
   - **Attachments**: If there are attachments, verify their file type. Attachments can often be disguised as benign documents (e.g., PDFs, Word files) but contain malware.

   **Objective**: Identify if the email contains malicious URLs, IPs, or suspicious attachments.

## 3. Identify Overall Endpoint Security Status üõ°Ô∏è
   Assess the security status of the endpoint receiving the email:
   - **Antivirus Status**: Ensure that antivirus software is up-to-date and running.
   - **Sandboxing**: If suspicious, open attachments or links in a sandboxed environment to prevent system-wide infections.
   - **User Permissions**: Check if the recipient has admin privileges, which could exacerbate the risk if the email is malicious.

   **Objective**: Verify the recipient's device security level to gauge how vulnerable the system is to email-based threats.

## 4. Identify Possible Sources of This Behavior üîé
   To understand the potential origin of the threat:
   - **Spoofed Domains**: Identify if the email is sent from a spoofed domain or a known trusted source.
   - **Third-Party Compromises**: Check whether the email might be a result of a third-party compromise, where a legitimate account has been hijacked.
   - **Botnets**: Investigate if the behavior aligns with mass-distributed campaigns, often using botnets to send emails in bulk.

   **Objective**: Analyze the possible origins of the suspicious activity and assess the likelihood of phishing, spoofing, or malware campaigns.

## 5. Identify Infection Radius üñ•Ô∏è
   After initial analysis, assess whether the email has already caused damage:
   - **Email Spread**: Has the email been forwarded to other users in the organization or externally?
   - **Affected Systems**: Check if multiple endpoints have been compromised as a result of interacting with the email.
   - **Infection Indicators**: Look for signs of malware, such as slow system performance, unexpected network traffic, or alerts from security tools.

   **Objective**: Identify the scope of the infection and determine how far the malicious email has spread.

## Summary üìù
By following this process, cybersecurity professionals can systematically analyze suspicious emails, identify potential threats, and respond accordingly to minimize damage. Always follow proper incident response protocols if an email is deemed malicious.
